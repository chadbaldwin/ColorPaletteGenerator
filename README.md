This is just a simple webpage that produces a color palette that you can take a screenshot of to include in documentation, design diagrams, etc.

I needed to include a color palette in some documentation I was building for a project. I noticed our UI designer had included a nice color palette in their documentation that I really liked, but it only had 4 or 5 colors. When I tried searching online to try and find a tool that could build that for me, none of them allowed adding an unlimited number of colors to the palette.

So that's what this page is for...it lets you throw together as many colors as you want into a palette which you can then screenshot and save to whatever you are working on.
